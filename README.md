**Iris Data Analysis Project**

Overview
This project demonstrates data analysis and visualization using Python's Pandas and Matplotlib libraries. The analysis is performed on the Iris dataset, a classic dataset containing measurements of iris flowers across three species. The project includes a Jupyter notebook that loads the data, explores it, performs basic analysis, and creates visualizations to illustrate findings.
Requirements
To run the notebook, you need the following Python libraries:

pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Files

iris_data_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the complete data analysis workflow, including:
Data loading from scikit-learn's Iris dataset
Data exploration (overview, statistical summary)
Basic analysis (means by species, sample counts)
Visualizations (bar plot, scatter plot, box plot)
Findings and observations


README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

Usage

Clone the repository:git clone <repository-url>


Navigate to the project directory:cd <repository-name>


Ensure dependencies are installed (see Requirements).
Open the Jupyter notebook:jupyter notebook iris_data_analysis.ipynb


Run all cells in the notebook to execute the analysis and generate visualizations.

Dataset
The project uses the Iris dataset, which is included in scikit-learn. It contains 150 samples with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and a species label (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).
Visualizations
The notebook produces three visualizations:

Bar Plot: Mean measurements for each feature by species.
Scatter Plot: Sepal length vs. sepal width, colored by species.
Box Plot: Distribution of petal length by species.

Findings
Key observations from the analysis:

Setosa has distinctly smaller petal measurements compared to other species.
Virginica generally has the longest petals, while Setosa has the shortest.
There is some overlap in sepal measurements between Versicolor and Virginica.
Setosa is well-separated from other species in scatter plots.
